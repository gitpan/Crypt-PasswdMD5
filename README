NAME
    unix_md5_crypt - Provides interoperable MD5-based crypt()
    function

SYNOPSIS
            use Crypt::PasswdMD5;

            $cryptedpassword = unix_md5_crypt($password, $salt);

DESCRIPTION
    the `unix_md5_crypt()' provides a crypt()-compatible interface
    to the rather new MD5-based crypt() function found in modern
    operating systems. It's based on the implementation found on
    FreeBSD 2.2.[56]-RELEASE and contains the following license in
    it:

     can do whatever you want with this stuff. If we meet some day, and you think
     this stuff is worth it, you can buy me a beer in return.   Poul-Henning Kamp

    `apache_md5_crypt()' provides a function compatible with
    Apache's `.htpasswd' files. This was contributed by Bryan Hart
