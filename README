MD5-based crypt()

This is a perl5 implementation of the MD5-based crypt() funcion
commonly found on modern Unix operating systems such as 
FreeBSD, where this module was born.

The original C code contained the following notice on it

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
 "THE BEER-WARE LICENSE" (Revision 42):
 <phk@login.dknet.dk> wrote this file.  As long as you retain this notice you
 can do whatever you want with this stuff. If we meet some day, and you think
 this stuff is worth it, you can buy me a beer in return.   Poul-Henning Kamp
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

This same licensing scheme applies to this code :-)

This implementation depends on MD5.pm to be correctly installed
on your system. It has been tested on FreeBSD 2.2.5-RELEASE and
2.2.6-RELEASE as well as on Digital Unix 3.0B. It should work on
any system where perl's MD5() works correctly.

Installing Crypt::PasswdMD5 should be as easy as unpacking the 
gzipped file and doing

		perl Makefile.PL
		make
		make test
		make install

The tests are very simple. Essentially, if the MD5 module works, 
this one *should* also work :)

If you have access to the source code/algorythms for other crypt()
schemes, please let me know.

Please send bugs, queries, suggestions to

Good luck.
